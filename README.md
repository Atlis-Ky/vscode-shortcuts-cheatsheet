DEVELOPER RESOURCE - VSCODE SHORTCUT CHEATSHEET

Simple but useful page to help you find / memorise keyboard shortcuts in Visual Studio Code. A great way to make your coding go a little smoother and a little quicker! Useful tool for developers across all stacks and frameworks :D

(Part of a collection of developer resources I'm working on right now to help out fellow dev's in their first few years of programming. next up, colour palettes!!)
